### Why this works for "Future You":
* **The "User Story":** Even if you're the only user, writing this out helps you realize if a feature is actually useful or just a distraction.
* **Proposed Implementation:** This is your "whiteboard" session. It helps you spot potential architectural headaches before you start coding.
* **Future Considerations:** This is the best place to dump those "cool ideas" that would otherwise distract you from finishing the core feature.

Would you like me to provide a **Refactor/Maintenance template** (for things like cleaning up technical debt), or should I show you how to **link these issues** to a GitHub Project board for better visualization?
